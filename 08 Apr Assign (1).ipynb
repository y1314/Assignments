    "Ans - The choice of the metric depends on the specific requirements and goals of the prediction task. Here are a few commonly used regression metrics for SVM regression models:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Mean Squared Error (MSE):** MSE is a widely used regression metric that measures the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values. It penalizes larger errors more heavily, making it sensitive to outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** RMSE is the square root of the MSE, and it represents the standard deviation of the residuals. Like MSE, it penalizes larger errors more heavily but provides an interpretable metric in the same unit as the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** MAE calculates the average absolute difference between the predicted and actual values. It is less sensitive to outliers compared to MSE since it does not square the errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. R-squared (RÂ²):** R-squared measures the proportion of variance in the target variable that can be explained by the model. It ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates a perfect fit. However, R-squared may not be the best metric if there are non-linear relationships in the data."

    "Ans - If your goal is to predict the actual price of a house as accurately as possible, the Mean Squared Error (MSE) would be a more appropriate evaluation metric than R-squared.\n",
    "\n",
    "MSE directly measures the average squared difference between the predicted and actual house prices. By squaring the differences, MSE penalizes larger errors more heavily, which aligns with your goal of predicting house prices as accurately as possible. This metric gives you a sense of the average magnitude of the errors made by the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, R-squared measures the proportion of variance in the target variable that can be explained by the model. While R-squared is a valuable metric for understanding the goodness of fit and the explanatory power of your model, it does not directly capture the accuracy of individual predictions."

    "Ans - When dealing with a dataset that contains a significant number of outliers, it is advisable to use an evaluation metric that is less sensitive to outliers. In such cases, the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) would be the most appropriate regression metric to use with SVM model.\n",
    "\n",
    "MAE calculates the average absolute difference between the predicted and actual values. Unlike the Mean Squared Error (MSE), which squares the errors, MAE treats all errors equally without giving more weight to larger errors. This makes MAE more robust to outliers since their impact is not magnified."

In such cases, choosing either MSE or RMSE would yield similar insights into the model's performance."
