    "Ans - Lasso Regression, also known as L1 regularization, is a linear regression technique that adds a penalty term to the ordinary least squares (OLS) loss function. The penalty term is proportional to the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients. This regularization technique encourages sparsity in the coefficient estimates by driving some coefficients to exactly zero, effectively performing feature selection. Here's how Lasso Regression differs from other regression techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feature Selection:** One key difference of Lasso Regression compared to other regression techniques is its ability to perform feature selection. By adding the L1 penalty term to the loss function, Lasso Regression drives some coefficients to exactly zero, effectively eliminating the corresponding features from the model. This makes Lasso Regression particularly useful when there are many predictors, and only a subset of them is expected to have a significant impact on the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Shrinkage:** Like Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression also applies regularization to the coefficient estimates. However, the regularization approach is different. While Ridge Regression uses L2 regularization, which shrinks the coefficients towards zero without eliminating them entirely, Lasso Regression uses L1 regularization, which can drive some coefficients to exactly zero. As a result, Lasso Regression tends to produce sparse models with a smaller number of non-zero coefficients compared to Ridge Regression."

    "Ans - The main advantage of using Lasso Regression for feature selection is its ability to automatically identify and select the most relevant features from a large set of predictors. Here are some key advantages of using Lasso Regression for feature selection:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Automatic Selection:** Lasso Regression performs feature selection automatically as part of the model fitting process. By adding an L1 regularization term to the loss function, Lasso Regression drives some coefficients to exactly zero, effectively eliminating the corresponding features from the model. This automatic selection removes the need for manual feature selection techniques or domain expertise to identify the relevant predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Avoids Overfitting:** Lasso Regression's feature selection property helps mitigate the risk of overfitting, especially in situations where there are many predictors compared to the number of observations. By eliminating irrelevant features and reducing the complexity of the model, Lasso Regression helps prevent the model from fitting noise or capturing spurious relationships in the data. This regularization property helps improve the model's generalization ability and can lead to better predictive performance on unseen data."

    "Ans - Interpreting the coefficients of a Lasso Regression model involves considering the magnitude and sign of the coefficients, as well as understanding the effect of the regularization term. Here's a step-by-step process for interpreting the coefficients:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Magnitude of Coefficients:** The magnitude of the coefficients in Lasso Regression indicates the strength of the relationship between each independent variable and the dependent variable. Larger coefficient values suggest a stronger impact of the corresponding variable on the target variable. The greater the magnitude, the larger the effect on the target variable for a unit change in the corresponding predictor.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sign of Coefficients:** The sign of the coefficients (positive or negative) indicates the direction of the relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable. A positive coefficient implies a positive relationship, where an increase in the independent variable leads to an increase in the dependent variable, while a negative coefficient implies a negative relationship, where an increase in the independent variable leads to a decrease in the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Relative Importance:** The relative importance of coefficients in Lasso Regression can be inferred based on their magnitude. Larger magnitude coefficients are considered more influential in the model, while smaller magnitude coefficients have less influence. You can compare the magnitudes of the coefficients to identify the most important predictors in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sparsity and Feature Selection:** One of the unique features of Lasso Regression is its ability to perform feature selection by driving some coefficients to exactly zero. A coefficient set to zero means that the corresponding feature has been excluded from the model. This sparsity property allows you to identify the subset of predictors that have the most significant impact on the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Regularization Effect:** It's important to consider the effect of the regularization term in Lasso Regression. The L1 regularization term in Lasso Regression introduces a bias towards sparse solutions by shrinking some coefficients to zero. The regularization term encourages sparsity by penalizing the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients. This regularization effect should be taken into account when interpreting the coefficients, as it influences their magnitude and selection."

    "Ans - In Lasso Regression, there is typically one main tuning parameter that can be adjusted to control the level of regularization: the regularization parameter (also known as lambda or alpha). The regularization parameter determines the strength of the penalty term applied to the coefficient estimates. By adjusting this parameter, you can control the degree of sparsity in the model and the extent to which coefficients are shrunk towards zero. \n",

    "Finding the appropriate value for the regularization parameter is often done using techniques like cross-validation or grid search, where different values of the parameter are tested, and the one that yields the best performance on validation data is selected. The choice of the regularization parameter requires careful consideration and depends on the specific dataset, the number of predictors, and the desired trade-off between model complexity and interpretability."

    "Lasso Regression, by itself, is a linear regression technique and is primarily designed for linear regression problems. It works by minimizing the sum of squared errors, subject to an L1 regularization term. However, Lasso Regression can be extended to handle non-linear regression problems by incorporating non-linear transformations of the predictors. Here's how Lasso Regression can be used for non-linear regression problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Non-Linear Transformations:** To handle non-linear regression problems using Lasso Regression, you can apply non-linear transformations to the predictors. This can include transformations such as polynomial features, logarithmic transformations, exponential transformations, or any other non-linear functions of the predictors. These transformations allow you to capture non-linear relationships between the predictors and the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feature Engineering:** In non-linear regression problems, feature engineering plays a crucial role. You can create new features by combining or transforming existing predictors to capture non-linear relationships. For example, you can create interaction terms, square terms, or other non-linear combinations of predictors. These engineered features can then be used as inputs to Lasso Regression."
