    "The KNN algorithm works based on the principle that similar data points are more likely to belong to the same class or have similar output values. Given a new, unlabeled data point, the algorithm finds the K nearest labeled data points (neighbors) in the training set based on a distance metric, typically Euclidean distance. The value of K is a user-defined parameter."

    "Ans - **KNN Classifier:**\n",
    "The KNN classifier is used for classification tasks, where the goal is to assign a class label to a given input data point. In the KNN classifier, the class label is determined by the majority vote of the K nearest neighbors. The class label with the highest count among the K neighbors is assigned to the input data point. For example, if K=5 and three neighbors belong to class A while two neighbors belong to class B, the input data point will be classified as class A.\n",

    "The KNN regressor, on the other hand, is used for regression tasks, where the goal is to predict a continuous output value for a given input data point. In the KNN regressor, the output value is calculated as the average (or weighted average) of the output values of the K nearest neighbors. The predicted output value is a numerical value, rather than a class label. For example, if K=5 and the output values of the five nearest neighbors are [2.5, 3.2, 3.7, 3.9, 4.1], the KNN regressor might predict the output value as the average of these values, which is approximately 3.68."
