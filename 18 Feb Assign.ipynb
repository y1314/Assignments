    "* Applications: Access to APIs ensures more flexibility in information-transfer processes.\n",

    "* Customization: Furthermore, it can serve as a solution to create different experiences for users, letting protocols, functions, and commands be adapted according to specific demands.\n",
    "* Efficiency: When you have content that is automatically published and made available on different channels simultaneously, APIs allow for more efficient data distribution.\n",

    "* A fixed scale is necessary.\n",

    "* To create API, programming knowledge is necessary.\n",
    "* Maintenance cost is very high.\n",
