    "Ans - **Ensemble vs. Single Model:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**- Random Forest Regressor:** It is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions. It builds a forest of trees and aggregates the predictions from each tree to produce the final result.\n",
    "**- Decision Tree Regressor:** It is a single model that consists of a single decision tree. It makes predictions by following a hierarchical tree-like structure, where each internal node represents a splitting criterion based on a feature, and each leaf node represents a prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prediction Process:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**- Random Forest Regressor:** The final prediction is obtained by averaging (or taking the median of) the predictions of individual trees in the ensemble. The aggregation of multiple tree predictions helps to reduce the variance and provide a more robust prediction.\n",
    "**- Decision Tree Regressor:** The prediction is made by traversing the decision tree based on the input features until reaching a leaf node. The prediction is then based on the value associated with that leaf node.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Handling Overfitting:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**- Random Forest Regressor:** By combining multiple decision trees and averaging their predictions, the ensemble reduces the risk of overfitting. The random feature subsets and bootstrap sampling further contribute to reducing overfitting tendencies.\n",
    "**- Decision Tree Regressor:** A single decision tree can easily overfit the training data, especially if it grows to a significant depth. Regularization techniques like limiting tree depth and setting minimum sample requirements for splitting can be applied to mitigate overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model Complexity:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**- Random Forest Regressor:** The ensemble of decision trees typically leads to a more complex model due to the combination of multiple trees and their interactions. The ensemble can capture complex relationships between features and the target variable.\n",
    "**- Decision Tree Regressor:** A single decision tree can be less complex compared to a random forest. It directly maps input features to predictions and is often interpretable due to its hierarchical structure."

    "- Random Forest Regressor tends to provide high prediction accuracy, often outperforming individual decision trees. By aggregating predictions from multiple trees, it captures complex relationships and reduces the risk of overfitting.\n",
    "- The averaging of predictions from multiple trees helps to smooth out the impact of individual noisy data points.\n",

    "**Disadvantages:** \n",
    "\n",
    "- Random Forest Regressor can be less interpretable compared to individual decision trees. The ensemble of trees makes it challenging to extract clear and intuitive rules or explanations of how the model arrived at a specific prediction.\n",
    "- Training and prediction times may be longer compared to simpler models like linear regression or decision trees.\n",
    "- The Random Forest Regressor requires storing multiple decision trees in memory, which can lead to a larger model size compared to individual decision trees. This can be a consideration in memory-constrained environments."

The predicted class label is determined by the most frequent class in the case of majority voting, or by averaging the class probabilities across the trees.\n",

    "The Random Forest Classifier is effective for classification problems because it combines the predictions of multiple decision trees, which can handle complex decision boundaries, interactions between features, and reduce the impact of individual tree's biases.
