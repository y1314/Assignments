    "\n",
    "The ratio scale is exactly the same as the interval scale, with one key difference: The ratio scale has what’s known as a “true zero.” \n",

    "A good example of ratio data is weight in kilograms. If something weighs zero kilograms, it truly weighs nothing—compared to temperature (interval data), where a value of zero degrees doesn’t mean there is “no temperature,” it simply means it’s extremely cold! "
